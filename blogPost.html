                    <p class="body_poem"> 
                        Leucon, no one's allowed to know his fate,<br>
                        Not you, not me: don't ask, don't hunt for answers<br>
                        In tea leaves or palms. Be patient with whatever comes.<br>
                        This could be our last winter, it could be many<br>
                        More, pounding the Tuscan Sea on these rocks:<br>
                        Do what you must, be wise, cut your vines<br>
                        And forget about hope. Time goes running, even<br>
                        As we talk. Take the present, the future's no one's affair.<br>
